Run convert.py. 
convert.py takes the following arguments:

HMMDEFS
 The path to a file that contains all the HTK model definitions.

TIEDLIST
 The path to a file that contains a list of HTK model names. Each name may
 be followed by the name of another model name, tying the models together.

 For example:
 A
 B
 A-B+A	B
 A-B+B	
 B-B+A
 B-B+B	B

OUT_PATH
 The path where the Sphinx 3 model files should be written. This is
 prepended to each Sphinx 3 file, so it may be a directory, a file prefix or
 a combination of both.

 For example:
 ~/dir/prefix.
 Will result in the following files:
 ~/dir/prefix.mdef
 ~/dir/prefix.mean
 ~/dir/prefix.var
 ~/dir/prefix.mixw
 ~/dir/prefix.tmat

 The script was developed originally by W.J. Maaskant
(w.j.maaskant(at)student.utwente.nl) for Fraunhofer IAIS, Germany to perform
a comparison of HTK, ISIP Prototype, Julius and HTK.
